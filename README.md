# Neural-Network-Classifier-using-Back-propagation
We implemented three layer neural network classifier using Back-propagation learning algorithm. We use Abalone Data Set from UCI as training and testing dataset. we divided the dataset in three groups: training, validation and testing. Optimized the weights using training data and optimized the model parameters using the validation data and calculated performance using the test data.
